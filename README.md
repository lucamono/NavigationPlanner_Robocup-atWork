# NavigationPlanner 

RoboCup@Work is a competition in RoboCup that targets the use of robots in work-related scenarios. It aims
to foster research and development that enables use of innovative mobile robots equipped with advanced
manipulators for current and future industrial applications, where robots cooperate with human workers for
complex tasks ranging from manufacturing, automation, and parts handling up to general logistics. The navigation
system for the robots is one of the critical parts in this kind of scenarios where holonomic robots performs paths
in presence of obstacles and smooth corridors. In this project we will show a new navigation system based on
cubic splines approach under a topological graph.
